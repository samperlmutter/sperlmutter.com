<h3>About</h3>
<p>I made this website for a school project and decided to turn it
	into a personal repository of some programs I made by myself and with
	some friends. Currently the only thing that's on here is an unfinished "game" I
	was making with my friends, but I plan on making it so I can upload pictures to the 
	site from my phone, converting a studying java app to javascript so it can work on a 
	website, and anything else I can think of.</p>
<h3><a href="/jsgame">The Javascript Game</a></h3>
<p>At first we were planning on making a
	game, but we didn't know what it was going to be so we ended up just
	playing around with Javascript and seeing what we could do and
	eventually it turned into a sort of planetary gravity simulator.</p>
