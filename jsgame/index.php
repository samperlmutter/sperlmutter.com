My friends and I decided to make a game because we had some free time during 
the build season of our robotics team. We didn't really have a lot of time to 
make it a full game so we decided to just see what we could do with javascript. 
What ended up happening was a sort of gravity simulator between two circles. 
The only thing you can do in it is control the green circle using the WASD keys, 
unfortunately there aren't any controls for mobile.
